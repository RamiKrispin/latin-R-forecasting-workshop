# Forecasting with Linear Regression Models

Materials for the "Forecasting with Linear Regression Models" workshop at the LaticR 2025 conference. 

This workshop focuses on the foundation of feature-based forecasting with linear regression using R. The workshop is beginner-friendly, and it covers the following topics:

- How to frame a time series as a regression problem
- Feature engineering techniques for time-aware data
- Modeling trend, seasonality, outliers, and breaks
- Practical tips for evaluation and validation

This workshop is for practitioners (data analysts/scientists) who wish to learn how to forecast with regression models. It assumes no background in time series analysis and forecasting, but assumes basic knowledge of probability, linear regression, and R programming.
